## Stuff I come up

+ I hope he can guess it, but if he doesn't, I won't dump him.
+ It might be ... whole one year thing.
+ So, we'll see.
+ Her hands are a little smaller, and so, feels a little different. so we'll have to see.
+ I'm sorry to the person on the other side if this is weird.
+ I'm like testing out a knuckle, like is that sara's knuckle, or is that somebody else's
+ but than you don't know how it's feel, the knuckle's feel like. so I don't even know I'm trying that.
+ there's little bit of game and ship going on. I think that part of you guys.  *** first. check out tayler.
+ oh, that's straight now. now this hand is a little bit bigger, if sofia's gotta be a big hand
+ So, wow, this is impossible.
+ I'm in pretty intense thought right now, this feel like a hand that I know.
+ this is warmth a little bit, which I'm adding desriptor, which could only hurt me if i'm wrong.
+ this hand feels like a hand I've been holding.
+ I think that sofis's hand is number 3, and I'm really hoping that it it because I'm really nervous right now.
+ No, who is that, it's two than.
+ No, I thought I would have know.
+ I don't know if she. she's mad.
+ Are you serious?
+ I would have been so good at this.
+ No, stop, it was not that easy. I could not really tell.
+ He did horribly.
+ Why did you think that the first hand was not my hand?
+ We don't walk this far apart. it's really what it is. and so we usually walk right next to each other.
+ so when we're further apart. it just feel different like the angle is different
+ No it's fine, i'm not mad.
+ I'm just disappointed.
+ Listen, I hold one hand for a year, and maybe if other people get them. they better at holding hands than us.
+ I think they're also pretty awesome being boyfriend and girlfriends right


## Stuff I miss

+ It might throw a wrench in that whole one year thing
+ I'm like, trying to test out her knuckles, like is that Soph's knuckles or is that somebody else's?
+ Um but then again I don't even know what Sophia's knuckles feel like so I don't even know why I'm trying that!
+ There's a little bit of gamesmanship going on here.
+ I think that part of you guys might have been like, let's put Sophia first, and trick out Tyler.
+ Ohh, this is tricky now.
+ and Sophia's got pretty big hands.
+ Ahh it's like the warmth, a little bit,
+ and like I'm adding in some descriptors which can only hurt me if I'm wrong.
+ Oh, I don't want to see...She's mad.
+ But we're pretty awesome at being boyfriend and girlfriend, right?
